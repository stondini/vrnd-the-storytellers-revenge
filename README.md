# The Storytellerâ€™s Revenge Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 5.6
- Developed & tested on iPhone 5s iOS 12.

## The Story
A kind of David Lynch's psychological road movie :)

On the road, Dave tries to find a nice and cool music radio channel.
Suddenly, strange lightnings and storm appears.
The last lightning teleports him into a colored tunnel, the radio becomes crazy !
At the end of the tunnel, he is again teleported aside of the road, without his car, no radio, no storm, no lightning. Just birds singing or something else...
What a Strange Road !

## Raw Footages
- 01 - Road
- 14 - The Bum on the Road
- 18 - Tunnel
All 3 videos was stitched using Autopano Video & Giga (the watermark is present).

## Sounds
I removed the sound tracks of the footages and replaced them by some free sounds from https://freesound.org
- Car motor
- Storm
- Birds

The radio channel sound comes from the song "Do It Again" by "The Queens of the Stone Age".

## Edition in Adobe Premiere
I used several effects :
- Opacity with Color Dodge for lightnings.
- VR Rotate Sphere to try to have a smooth transition between clips (same "view angle").
- Brightness on keyframes at the exit of the tunnel.
- Distortion of the sound at the exit of the tunnel.

## 3D Audio Sources
3 audio sources in the last scene :
- 1 source with cars
- 2 sources with Birds

## Interactions
- During the movie, the chapters choice buttons are always present. User can jump through chapters.
- At the end of the tunnel, user can choose the end. Either Heaven or Hell.
- At the end, the choice buttons allow navigation.

## Test
Playing video using Dropbox URL is very slow. In Unity and on the device.
I tried using fast Wifi and mobile 4G network and de performance was not good.
Maybe the cause is my "old" iPhone 5s.
