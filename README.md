## The Story
A kind of David Lynch's psychological road movie :)

On the road, Dave tries to find a nice and cool music radio channel.
Suddenly, strange lightnings and storm appears.
The last lightning teleports him into a colored tunnel, the radio becomes crazy !
At the end of the tunnel, he is again teleported aside of the road, without his car, no radio, no storm, no lightning. Just birds singing.
What a Strange Road !
